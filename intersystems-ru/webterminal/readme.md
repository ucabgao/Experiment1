### Development
We are glad to see anyone who want to contribute to Caché WEB Terminal development! Check the 
[developer's](https://github.com/intersystems-ru/webterminal/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.md) guide.

In short, the "hot start" is extremely easy. Having latest [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed,
execute the following:

```sh
git clone <this repository URL>  # clone this repository into new directory
cd <cloned repository name>      # enter just created directory
npm install -g gulp              # install the global module "gulp" to build the project
npm install                      # install all project's dependencies
gulp                             # build the project
```

Now, in `build` folder you will find `CacheWebTerminal-v*.xml` file ready to import. Every time you
changes is ready to be tested, just run `gulp` command and import generated XML into Caché.
